<h2 align="center"><u>LEAVE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM</u></h2>
<pre align="center"><font face="cursive" size="4">
  Research shows companies spend almost 15% of their payroll cost on leave benefits. 
This has a significant impact on the bottom line of a company. Traditional leave 
management involves leave request being made using a paper application or through
email. The leave data is maintained in a separate Microsoft Excel file. This 
system is not only paper intensive but also very time consuming.

Approving a leave request becomes a daunting task for the managers in the absence 
of required information like the leave balance of an employee, his last availed 
leaves and the other team members who have applied for leave during the similar 
period. Traditional leave management systems are not only difficult to implement 
but also consume significant productive hours of the employees.</font>
